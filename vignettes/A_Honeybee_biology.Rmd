# Introduction

This vignette describes and demonstrates how SIMplyBee implements honeybee
biology. Specifically, it describes:

1.  initiating simulation with founder genomes and simulation parameters,

2.  creating and building up a colony,

3.  colony structure, and

4.  complementary sex determining (*CSD*) locus.

Further topics about honeybee biology, such as colony events, reproduction, and
other aspects, are covered in other vignettes.

First, you need to install the package with
`install.packages(pkg = "SIMplyBee")`.

Now load the package and dive in! You load the package by running:

```{r load}
library(package = "SIMplyBee")
```

# Initiating simulation with founder genomes and global parameters

Figure 1 visualizes the initiation of the simulation. First, we simulate some
honeybee genomes that represent the founder population. You can quickly generate
random genomes using AlphaSimR's `quickHaplo()`. These founder genomes are
rapidly simulated by sampling chromosomes as series of 0s and 1s, and do not
include any species-specific demographic history. This is equivalent to all loci
having allele frequency 0.5 and being in linkage equilibrium. We use this
approach only for demonstrations and testing.

Alternatively, you can more accurately simulate honeybee genomes with
SIMplyBee's `simulateHoneyBeeGenomes()`. This function simulates the honeybee
genome using coalescent simulation of whole chromosomes using MaCS (Chen et al.,
2009) for three subspecies: *A. m. ligustica*, *A. m. carnica*, and *A. m.
mellifera* according to the demographic model described by Wallberg et al.
(2014).

As a demonstration, we will use `quickHaplo()` and simulate genomes of two
founding individuals. In this example, the genomes will be represented by only
three chromosomes and 1,000 segregating sites per chromosome. Honeybees have 16
chromosomes and far more segregating sites per chromosome, but we want a quick
simulation here.

```{r founder genomes}
founderGenomes <- quickHaplo(nInd = 2, nChr = 3, segSites = 100)
```

As mentioned, the `simulateHoneyBeeGenomes()` generates more realistic
chromosome samples, but also requires much more time. Hence, when you use
`simulateHoneyBeeGenomes()`, we suggest you save the output to an RData file
that you then load in your environment and work with it. See the function
documentation using `help(simulateHoneyBeeGenomes)` to learn all the parameters
involved in the function.

Now we are ready to setup global simulation parameters using `SimParamBee`.
`SimParamBee` builds upon AlphaSimR's `SimParam`, which includes genome and
trait parameters, but also global pedigree and recombination events. We usually
save the output of `SimParamBee` as the `SP` object (we will assume this in all
vignettes). Namely, all SIMplyBee functions will use this object if you don't
directly specify `simParamBee` argument. `SimParamBee` additionally holds
honeybee specific simulation information (Figure 1):

-   default number of workers (`SP$nWorkers`) and drones (`SP$nDrones`) in a
    full-sized colony; these numbers are used by functions such as
    `createWorkers/Drones()`, `addWorkers/Drones()` and `buildUp()`;
-   default number of drones that a virgin queen mates with (`SP$nFathers`)
-   the *CSD* information: the chromosome of the *CSD* (`SP$csdChr`), the
    position (`SP$csdPos`), and the desired number of *CSD* alleles in a
    population (`SP$nCsdAlleles`). The number of *CSD* alleles determines the
    length of the *CSD* locus (`SP$nCsdSites`): `nCsdAlleles = nCsdSites**2`. By
    default, the *CSD* is placed on its real genomic position on chromosome 3.
    However, if the user simulates less than three chromosomes, the *CSD* is
    placed on chromosome 1;
-   pedigree for each individual created in the simulation (`SP$pedigree`) if
    requested by `SP$setTrackPed(TRUE)`; and
-   caste information for each individual created in the simulation
    (`SP$caste`).

You can read more about the `SimParam` and `SimParamBee` in their help pages
(`help(SimParam)` and `help(SimParamBee)`).

Below we use set the number of *CSD* alleles and default number of workers and
drones in a colony:

```{r SimParamBee}
SP <- SimParamBee$new(founderGenomes, nCsdAlleles = 32)
SP$nWorkers <- 100
SP$nDrones <- 10
```

After creating the `SimParamBee` object, you can inspect it! This returns a lot
of output and we suggest you return back to this point once you are comfortable
with the basic functionality!

```{r SP, eval = FALSE}
print(SP)
```

```{r initialization_diagram, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.cap = "Simulation initiation"}
knitr::include_graphics("founderpop.png")
```

From the simulated founder genomes, we can create virgin queens (Figure 1).
These will serve as our our first honeybee individuals (the so called base or
founder population). In AlphaSimR and SIMplyBee, individuals are stored in `Pop`
class objects, that hold a group of individuals with their individual
identification, parent identifications, as well as genomes and trait values. So,
the `basePop` is a population (`Pop` class object) of two individuals, our two
virgin queens. If we print out `basePop`, we see some basic information about
the population: the ploidy, number of individuals, chromosome, loci, and traits.
We next check whether our individuals are of certain caste with `is*()`
functions, where `*` can be either `queen`, `worker`, `drone`, `virginQueen`, or
`father`. These functions return `TRUE` if the individual is a member of the
caste in question and `FALSE` is it is not. These functions check the caste
information in the `SP$caste`. Here, we use `isVirginQueen()` to check whether
our base population individuals are virgin queens.

```{r base pop virgin queens}
baseQueens <- createVirginQueens(founderGenomes)
baseQueens
isVirginQueen(baseQueens)
```

Similarly, you can use the function `getCaste()` to get the caste of each
individual.

We will use the first virgin queen to create five drones for future mating. Note
that virgin queens do not create drones. Only queens with colonies create
drones. However, to get the simulation up and running, we need drones and the
function `createDrones()` can work both with virgin queens or colonies (we will
present colonies in the next section). You can use more than one virgin queen to
create the drones or even an entire drone congregation area (DCA) with as many
drones per virgin queen as you want (`nInd`).

```{r base pop drones}
baseDrones <- createDrones(x = baseQueens[1], nInd = 15)
baseDrones
```

# Creating and building up a colony

We will use the other virgin queen to create a colony. You can use more than one
virgin queen to create more than one colony. In SIMplyBee, a honeybee colony is
stored in an object of `Colony` class. You can create a new colony with the
function `createColony()`. You can create a completely empty colony or a colony
with either a virgin or a mated queen. The `Colony` class organises all its
members in five castes: `queen`, `fathers`, `workers`, `drones`, and
`virginQueens`. We describe the castes in next section. The `Colony` further
contains technical information about the colony, its identification `id` and
`location` coordinates coded as (`latitude`, `longitude`). Further, it contains
logical information about the past colony events: `split`, `swarm`,
`supersedure`, or `collapse`. It also contains `production` status, which
indicates whether we can collect a production phenotype from the colony. The
latter is possible when the colony is built-up to its full size and has not
swarmed. The production is turned off when a colony downsizes, collapses, or
swarms, and for the split of a split colony. You will learn about these colony
events in the Colony events vignette.

```{r colony}
colony <- createColony(x = baseQueens[2])
colony
```

We see all the above mentioned information in the printout of the `Colony`
object. For this specific colony, we see that the ID of the colony is "8", the
location is not set, and there is no queen (hence `NA`). There are consequently
no fathers in the colony, nor any workers, drones or virgin queens. All the
events are set to `FALSE` (you will learn more about events in the Colony events
vignette) and the colony is not productive, since it does not include any
individuals.

Let's now mate our virgin queen, so that she is promoted to a queen and can
start laying eggs of her own workers and drones.

```{r cross colony}
colony <- cross(colony, drones = baseDrones, checkCross = "warning")
colony
```

We see that the virgin queen is now a queen - hence we have a queen with the ID
"2" and no virgin queens in our colony.

Next, let's build up our colony using the function `buildUp()` that adds in
workers and drones. This function takes parameters `nWorkers` and `nDrones`,
where we specify how many workers and drones to add. However, if these numbers
are not specified in the function's call, the function uses the default numbers
from the `SimParamBee` object (`SP$nWorkers` and `SP$nDrones`). This function
also always turns the `production` status to `TRUE`, since it assumes we are
building the colony up to its full-size.

```{r build up colony}
buildUp(colony, nWorkers = 10, nDrones = 7)
buildUp(colony)
```

All the functions in SIMplyBee return objects, hence we need to save them as an
object, otherwise they are lost.

```{r buildup and save}
colony <- buildUp(colony)
colony
```

# Colony structure

Lets explore our colony. In every colony we have different groups of individuals
(castes). These include: queen, fathers, workers, drones, and virgin queens. The
queen controls the colony, workers do all the hard work, drones disseminate
queen's genes, and one of the virgin queens will eventually replace the queen.
We also store fathers, which represent drones that the queen mated with. The
fathers caste is effectively the drone sperm stored in queen's spermatheca.
Storing fathers enables us to generate colony members on demand. SIMplyBee
contains `n*()` functions to count the number of individuals in each caste,
where `*` is `queen`, `fathers`, `workers`, `drones`, and `virginQueens`. Let's
count how many individuals we have for each caste in our colony.

```{r colony numbers 1}
nQueens(colony)
```

```{r colony numbers 2}
nFathers(colony)
```

```{r colony numbers 3}
nWorkers(colony)
```

```{r colony numbers 4}
nDrones(colony)
```

```{r colony numbers 5}
nVirginQueens(colony)
```

Next, we can access the individuals of each caste with `get*()` functions. These
functions leave the colony and its members intact (they do not change the
colony) by copying the individuals.

```{r colony castes via get 1}
(queen <- getQueen(colony))
```

```{r colony castes via get 2}
(fathers <- getFathers(colony))
```

```{r colony castes via get 3}
(workers <- getWorkers(colony))
```

```{r colony castes via get 4}
(drones <- getDrones(colony))
```

```{r colony castes via get 5}
(virginQueens <- getVirginQueens(colony))
```

As you see above, there are no virgin queens present in the colony at this
moment, since the queen is active. Future colony events might change this.

Should you want to pull out, that is, remove castes or their members, have a
look at `pull*()` functions. These functions return a list of objects: `pulled`
being the pulled individuals (`Pop` object), and `remnant` being the remaining
colony without the pulled individuals.

```{r remnant}
tmp <- pullWorkers(colony, n = 10)
colony <- tmp$remnant
colony
```

```{r pulled workers}
pulledWorkers <- tmp$pulled
pulledWorkers
```

Next, you can obtain the caste of each individual with the `getCaste()`
function. As already mentioned above, a similar group of functions are the
`is*()` functions that check whether an individual is of specific caste. Let's
now obtain the caste of colony members:

```{r caste queen}
getCaste(queen)
```

```{r caste fathers}
getCaste(fathers)
```

and so on. When you have a collection of bees at hand and you might not know
their source, the `getCaste()` can be very useful:

```{r caste bees}
bees <- c(queen, fathers[1:2], workers[1:2], drones[1:2])
getCaste(bees)
```

# Complementary sex determining locus

The complementary sex determiner (*CSD*) locus, well, complements sex
determination. Fertilised eggs that are heterozygous at the *CSD* locus develop
into workers. On the other hand, homozygous eggs develop into unviable drones.
These drones are usually discarded by workers. SIMplyBee does not store these
unviable drones, but it does store their number in the queen's miscellaneous
slot (`queen@misc`). Here, you can find the total number of workers and drones
produced by the queen (`nWorkers` and `nDrones`) and how many of the diploid
offspring were homozygous at the *CSD* (`nHomBrood`). There is also a
`pHomBrood` slot, that represents the theoretical (expected) proportion of
offspring that are expected to be homozygous based on queen's and father's *CSD*
alleles. You can obtain `pHomBrood` and `nHomBrood` values with the
corresponding `pHomBrood()` and `nHombrood()` functions that can be applied
either on the queen (`Pop` class) or colony (`Colony` class) directly. You can
obtain the entire `misc` slot using:

```{r misc}
getQueen(colony)@misc
```

Technically, in SIMplyBee we represent the *CSD* locus as a series of bi-allelic
single nucleotide polymorphisms that don't recombine. So, the *CSD* locus is
represented as a non-recombining haplotype and different haplotypes represent
different *CSD* alleles. By varying the number of sites within the *CSD* locus
we can control the number of distinct alleles (see `help(SimParamBee)`).

We can retrieve information about *CSD* alleles with `getCsdAlleles()`. For
details on where the *CSD* locus is and the number of distinct alleles, see
`help(SimParamBee)`. Looking at the below output, the first row shows marker
identifications (chromosome_locus) and the first column shows haplotype
identifications (individual_haplotype). The alleles are represented with a
sequence of 0's and 1's. You can see that the two sequences are different,
meaning that the queen is heterozygous, as expected.

```{r csd}
getCsdAlleles(queen)
```

A keen geneticist would immediately inspect *CSD* alleles of fathers to check
for any similarity with the queen's *CSD* alleles. Let's boost a chance of such
an event by creating an inbreed colony. We will create a virgin queen from the
current colony and mate her with her brothers. Oh, dear.

```{r inbred colony}
inbredColony <- createColony(x = createVirginQueens(x = colony, nInd = 1))
fathers <- selectInd(drones, nInd = SP$nFathers, use = "rand")
inbredColony <- cross(inbredColony, drones = fathers, checkCross = "warning")
getCsdAlleles(inbredColony)
getCsdAlleles(inbredColony, unique = TRUE)
```

Can you spot any matches? Let's calculate the expected proportion of homozygous
brood from this mating.

```{r pHomBrood}
pHomBrood(inbredColony)
```

Let's see how many homozygotes will we observe. Note that inheritance is a
random process, so a realised number of homozygotes will deviate from the
expected proportion.

```{r hHomBrood}
inbredColony <- addWorkers(inbredColony, nInd = 100)
inbredColony
nHomBrood(inbredColony)
```

We tried adding 100 workers, but we only got `r nWorkers(inbredColony)`. The
difference of `r nHomBrood(inbredColony)` is due to *CSD* homozygous brood.
Let's add another set of workers to show variation in the realised numbers and
accumulation of information.

```{r hHomBrood II}
inbredColony <- addWorkers(inbredColony, nInd = 100)
inbredColony
nHomBrood(inbredColony)
```

In total we tried adding 200 workers. We got `r nWorkers(inbredColony)` workers
and `r nHomBrood(inbredColony)` homozygous brood. To see all this information,
we can inspect the miscellaneous slot of the queen that contains the fathers
population as well as the cumulative number of workers, drones, homozygous
brood, and the expected proportion of homozygous brood.

```{r queens counters}
getQueen(inbredColony)@misc
```
